Read SPEC.md for full context. The game is fully functional and polished.

Implement Phase 4: Expand the card library in /data/cards.json.

Write a full set of original cards — do NOT copy Cards Against Humanity content. All cards must be original.

Target:
- 100 black cards (prompts): ~75 pick-1, ~25 pick-2
- 500 white cards (answers)

Guidelines for card writing:
- Black cards should have clear blanks marked with "_"
- Pick-2 black cards should have two blanks that create a narrative or contrast
- White cards should range from absurd to dark to mundane — variety is key
- Mix of: pop culture references, everyday situations, absurd scenarios, mild shock humor
- Cards should be funny when combined with many different partners (high combinatorial humor)
- Avoid anything that references specific copyrighted characters or real people by name
- Keep cards concise — most white cards should be 1-6 words, black cards should be 1-2 sentences max

After writing the cards, update the card loading logic if needed and verify the game still works with the expanded deck (deck reshuffling when cards run out should still function).
